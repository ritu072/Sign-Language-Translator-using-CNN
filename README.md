# 🖐️ Sign Language Translator Using Deep Learning  
A real-time Sign Language Recognition system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **OpenCV** to translate hand gestures into text.  

## 📌 Features  
✔ **Real-time sign detection** using a webcam  
✔ Recognizes **A-Z hand gestures** from the American Sign Language (ASL) dataset  
✔ Uses **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** for high accuracy (~97.92%)  
✔ Works without gloves or sensors (only requires a webcam)  
✔ Can be improved with **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)**
